# Hackathon Overview


# Training Data Description
The training data comprises 99300 jpg images of handwritten mathematical symbols. Each image is greyscale and is
30x30. There are 40 different symbols. A symbolâ€™s label is given in the file name. A file name is of the form
imageid_imagelabel.jpg, for example
32_infinity.jpg, or 33247_greater_than.jpg.

# Test Data Description
The only difference between an image in the test data set and the training data set is that there is no image label in the file name. So the name of a test image would be something like $\texttt{45.jpg}$. There are 14000 test images.
